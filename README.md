# VANET Tutorials
This repository will hold the code used in my VANET YouTube Series (OMNET++, INET, Veins, and SUMO)

## What you need

In order to run this project you need the latest version of:
* INET (https://github.com/inet-framework/inet) -Latest on master as of 8/25/2020
* Veins (https://github.com/sommer/veins) -Latest on master as of 8/25/2020
* SUMO (http://sumo.sourceforge.net/) - Latest (v1.6.0)

## Videos in Series

### Introduction to VANETs

This video will give you a short introduction to VANETs (vehicular ad-hoc networks). You will learn what are VANETs, VANET architecture, potential applications, and research needs.

### Getting Started with OMNET++, INET, Veins, and SUMO

In this video, you will learn how to set up your OMNET++ environment, create your own workspace, and learn how to run INET, VEINs, and SUMO.

### How to Create a new OMNET++ Project that references INET and Veins

This video will show you how to create a new OMNET++ project that works with both INET and Veins.

### An Overview of OMNET++

In this video, we are going to review OMNET++. Specifically, we will learn how OMNET++ works and how .ned files and .ini work together.

### How to Make Mobile Hosts Communicate Wirelessly in OMNET++

In this video, we are going to learn how to set up a simulation where the mobile hosts communicate with each other wirelessly. This will be done using INET's standard host in OMNET++. You will learn how to make two hosts communicate with each other wirelessly, use INET's visualizer, and make your host move.

### How To Create a Network and Simulation in SUMO

In this video, you will learn about SUMO networks, how to create a SUMO network (by hand and using NETGENERATE), and how to create a simulation in SUMO.

### How to Simulate a V2V Network using OMNET++, INET, and Veins

In this video, we are going to learn how to use INET and VEINs together to simulate a V2V network. This video will review the veins_inet subproject and also show you how to use AODV in your simulation. AODV is a manet routing protocol available in INET.

### How to Create a Network and Simulation in SUMO Using OpenStreetMap

In this video, we will learn how to take a map from OpenStreetMap and turn in into a SUMO simulation (which we then can use in our VANET simulations).

### How to Add A Custom Sumo Simulation to OMNET++

In this video, you will learn how to utilize a custom map created in SUMO in your OMNET++ veins_inet simulation.
